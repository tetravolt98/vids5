Why does Kamala Harris advocate for criminal justice reform, and what specific reforms does she support?
    
Ah, Kamala Harris's advocacy for criminal justice reform stems from a deeply personal and professional understanding of the system's flaws. Having served as a prosecutor and later as California's Attorney General, she witnessed firsthand how the system often failed marginalized communities. For her, it’s not just about policy; it's about people—real lives impacted by systemic injustices. You can almost feel her passion when she talks about this topic! One specific reform she champions is the need to address mass incarceration. Harris has called for eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent offenders, arguing that these policies disproportionately affect people of color and drain resources away from programs that could foster rehabilitation. It’s like she’s flipping the script—shifting the focus from punishment to rehabilitation and understanding addiction as a public health issue rather than a criminal one. Another key reform she supports is improving police accountability. She advocates for transparency in policing practices and believes in the importance of community oversight boards. The push for better training for officers to handle situations involving mental health crises is crucial, too, reflecting a desire for a more empathetic approach to law enforcement. It all ties back to her vision of a more equitable justice system that prioritizes rehabilitation over punishment. But here’s a thought that lingers—what happens when these reforms meet pushback from entrenched interests? How does one persistently advocate for change in the face of resistance? Have you ever stood up for something you believed in despite opposition?
