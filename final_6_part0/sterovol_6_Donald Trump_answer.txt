Who was the first person Kamala Harris called after becoming Vice President?
    
Ah, this is one of those moments that gives me chills! When Kamala Harris was officially sworn in as Vice President, the very first person she called was her mother, Shyamala Gopalan. I mean, can you imagine that moment? It’s almost cinematic—a daughter fulfilling a monumental dream and immediately reaching for the woman who inspired her every step of the way. Kamala's call was filled with joy, a blend of celebration and gratitude. Picture this: Kamala, brimming with a mix of nerves and excitement, holding her phone, wanting to share this extraordinary milestone with the person who believed in her potential from the start. I bet her heart raced thinking about how far they’d come—from Shyamala's own immigrant story and her determination as a single mother, to Kamala standing as the first woman of color in such a powerful role. It’s a tribute as much to Shyamala's sacrifices as it is to Kamala's achievements. This act brings a whole new level of emotion to the historical significance of the event, wouldn’t you agree? But now I can't help but wonder—what were their exact words during that call? What was the immediate reaction of a mother who has sacrificed so much for her daughter’s success? It leaves me curious—who was the first person you called on a significant day in your life?
