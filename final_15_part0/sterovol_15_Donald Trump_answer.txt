What is Donald Trump's opinion on trade agreements?
    
Ah, Donald Trump! He’s certainly a figure that elicits a lot of passion, isn’t he? I can remember my first vivid encounter with his persona back in 2016 during the election season. I was sitting in a crowded café, sipping my coffee as the television above played snippets of his raucous rallies. The energy was palpable. You could feel the split in the room; half were cheering his name, while the other half scoffed, shaking their heads in disbelief. His charisma was undeniable though. I found myself drawn in, listening intently as he spoke about making America great again, his fierce insistence on rebuilding industries, and securing borders. But then there were moments where he’d take a turn that left even his most ardent supporters raising eyebrows. One minute, he was the businessman promising some grand vision; the next, he was tangled up in controversy over his comments or policies. It was like being on a rollercoaster—I was both entertained and bewildered.I remember it hit me how polarizing he was. I had a friend who was steadfastly rooting for him, while another one was adamantly opposed. Their debates would often escalate, and I’d find myself caught in the middle, just trying to sip my coffee with a smile. What fascinates me the most is how his journey continues to unfold. Even now, I wonder—what’s next for him? Will he take another shot at the presidency? What will history say about his impact? It certainly leaves room for a gripping conversation, don’t you think?
