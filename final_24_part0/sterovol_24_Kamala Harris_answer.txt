What are the major themes in Kamala Harris's speeches?
    
Ah, Kamala Harris—what a captivating figure! I remember the first time I really tuned into her story. It was during the 2020 primaries when she was making waves. There was this video of her taking on Joe Biden in a debate, confronting him about his past on busing, and I was just glued to my screen. Her voice was strong, and you could sense the weight of her words. It wasn’t just about politics; it was like she was echoing the sentiments of countless marginalized voices.She has this incredible background—born to immigrant parents, a trailblazer in so many ways. I felt a wave of inspiration as I thought about her journey from a tough district attorney in San Francisco to the Attorney General of California, and ultimately to the Vice Presidency. When she became the first female vice president, the first Black vice president, and the first Asian-American vice president, I couldn't help but feel a surge of pride. But there’s always that suspense in politics, right? With every achievement, there seemed to be new challenges. The nation was scrambling with its divisive issues, and she was right in the thick of it. I remember wondering, how would she navigate the complexity of her roles, balancing the demands of her office while staying true to her beliefs? As I continued to follow her journey through the Biden administration, I found myself wondering: What legacy will she ultimately leave behind? And with the next election just around the corner, will she continue to rise, or will the pressure of her position lead her in an unexpected direction?
