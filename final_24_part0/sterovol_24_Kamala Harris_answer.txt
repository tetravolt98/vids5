What are the major themes in Kamala Harris's speeches?
    
Ah, Kamala Harris! You know, I remember the first time I really paid attention to her as a public figure. It was during her 2020 presidential campaign. I was actually at a coffee shop, and they had the TV on, broadcasting one of her speeches. I found myself captivated by her energy and conviction. The way she spoke about women's rights and social justice lit a fire in the room; even the barista was listening intently. I was especially struck by her story—growing up as the daughter of immigrants, breaking through the glass ceiling in a male-dominated field, and then becoming the first female Vice President of the United States. It felt like I was witnessing a pivotal moment in history unfold right before my eyes. There’s this one anecdote that still gives me chills. During the vice-presidential debate, when she famously said, "I am speaking," it was powerful. It was not just a statement but a declaration of her presence and authority in a space that has historically marginalized voices like hers. And I think that moment sparked a conversation that many of us were eager to join, about representation and the role of women in leadership.But what really had me on the edge of my seat was the night of the election results. As the votes were being counted, I couldn’t help but wonder, would she win? How would it change America? I mean, it felt like the world was holding its breath waiting for that answer. So, I have to ask, what do you think her legacy will look like in the years to come?
