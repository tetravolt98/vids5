What is Donald Trump's business background and experience?
    
Ah, Donald Trump! Love him or hate him, he's undeniably one of the most discussed figures in recent history. I remember the first time I saw him on TV as a kid; he was larger than life, exuding confidence in that unmistakable steel-blue suit with the vibrant tie. Did you ever notice how he always seems to command the room? I mean, he has this magnetic personality that draws people in, whether they’re cheering for him or vehemently opposing him. I’ve been fascinated by his journey—starting with his real estate empire in New York City, all the way to his unexpected rise as President. It’s like watching a reality show unfold, and sometimes I find myself glued to the screen, waiting for the next twist. There were moments when I thought, "Can he really pull that off?"—like his infamous Tweets that sent shockwaves through the media, or the way he shook up traditional political norms.If you dive into his backstory, it’s even more compelling. From his father’s business influence to his controversial decisions while in office, it’s a complex narrative filled with ups and downs. And yet, I can’t help but wonder—what kind of legacy will he leave behind? Has he reshaped the political landscape for good, or will history view him through a different lens? Just imagine if we could sit down for a cup of coffee with him—what questions would you ask him? What would you want to know about the man behind the controversies?
