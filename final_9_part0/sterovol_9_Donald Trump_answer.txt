What businesses did Donald Trump own before entering politics?
    
Oh, Donald Trump, what a character! I remember the first time I tuned into one of his speeches. It was during the 2016 election cycle, and I found myself glued to the TV, just trying to process what I was seeing and hearing. He was so unapologetically himself—bold, brash, and completely unfiltered. I couldn’t help but be fascinated by how he seemed to command the room, effortlessly flipping conventional political rhetoric on its head.One moment that stands out to me was when he insisted on using the term "fake news" to describe the media. I swear, you could feel the tension in the air! It was as if he had thrown a grenade into the conversation, and the aftermath was nothing short of explosive. People either loved him or loathed him, which made every rally a wild carnival of emotions. I found myself pondering how one person could evoke such fervor—drawing in huge crowds while simultaneously provoking outrage.What really kept me on my toes was his unpredictable nature. You never knew what he might say next. Just when I thought he was about to settle down with a classic political trope, he'd pivot into something completely unexpected. It was electrifying!But here’s the twist: just when everyone thought they had figured him out, he'd do something that left everyone scratching their heads. Like, remember his approach to foreign policy? It had everyone on the edge of their seats, wondering what would come next. The cliffhanger never seems to end! So, I can’t help but ask—what’s your take on his influence on politics today? Is it still unfolding in ways we can't predict?
