What are Donald Trump's views on immigration policy?
    
Ah, Donald Trump! He’s someone who sparks a whirlwind of opinions, isn’t he? I remember the first time I really tuned into his speeches—it was during the 2016 election. I was sitting in a coffee shop, sipping my usual caramel latte, when his voice boomed through the TV mounted on the wall. There he was, gesticulating animatedly with those unmistakable hand movements, talking about making America great again. At first, I thought, "This guy is a showman!" His charisma was undeniable. People were either cheering or booing passionately, and it was like watching a live-action drama unfold. I found myself consuming everything I could about him—his classic quotes, controversies, and the way he seemed to thrive on conflict. It was a wild ride of unpredictability.But what really captured my attention wasn’t just his policies or his outlandish statements; it was the way he forged ahead relentlessly, almost like he was playing a game where the stakes were sky-high. I wondered, though, how much was the real Trump and how much was just an exaggerated persona? That question lingered like the last sip of a strong espresso, leaving a bitter sweetness behind.Now, as I reflect on his presidency and the ripples it created in the political landscape, I can’t help but wonder—what would happen if he decided to run again? Would he ignite the same fervor, or has the political landscape shifted too much? What do you think? What’s your take on his impact on American politics, and how do you see it evolving?
