What economic policies did Donald Trump push during his time in office?
    
You know, my impressions of Donald Trump have always been a mix of intrigue and skepticism. I remember sitting in a café during the 2016 election, where people were gathered around streaming debates on their phones. The energy in the room was electric, but what struck me the most was how he could command attention with just a few words. I mean, regardless of how you feel about him, you can't deny his ability to connect with a crowd.What I found fascinating was the way he leveraged social media. All those late-night tweets seemed reckless to some, but I wondered—was he just playing a different game? As someone who often struggles to get my own words out in a room, I admired his audacity to say what he thought, even if it was controversial. I still recall the uproar when he discussed building a wall or his rallying cries about 'fake news.' It was as if he was a lightning rod for both fervent support and vehement opposition.But then, something curious happened. Post-presidency, I saw him evolve into a kind of political celebrity, like a rare creature that just won’t go away, drawing vast crowds even in the face of legal challenges. I vividly remember watching a recent rally on TV; his fans were transfixed, hanging on his every word. So here’s what gets me thinking: could he pull off another political comeback, or has he reached a tipping point? What do you think? Would people rally behind him once more, or is the tide turning for good?
